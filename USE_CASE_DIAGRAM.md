# Auction System - Use Case Diagram

## Overview
This document describes the use case diagram for the Auction System. The diagram was generated by analyzing the codebase and identifying all actors, use cases, and their relationships.

## How to View the Diagram
1. Open [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)
2. Click "Open Existing Diagram"
3. Select the `use-case-diagram.drawio` file from this repository
4. The diagram will be displayed and can be edited if needed

## Actors

### 1. Bidder (User)
A bidder is a regular user of the auction system who can participate in auctions by registering, viewing items, and placing bids.

### 2. Admin
An administrator who manages the auction system, creates auctions, adds items, manages bidders, and finalizes sales.

## Use Cases

### Common Use Cases (Both Bidder & Admin)
1. **Register User** - New users can register to the system as bidders
2. **Login** - Users authenticate to access the system
3. **Change Password** - Users can update their password
4. **View Auctions** - Users can view different types of auctions

### Bidder Use Cases
5. **View Upcoming Auctions** - View auctions that haven't started yet (included in "View Auctions")
6. **View Live Auctions** - View currently active auctions (included in "View Auctions")
7. **View Completed Auctions** - View finished auctions (included in "View Auctions")
8. **Register for Auction** - Bidders register to participate in specific auctions
9. **View Registered Auctions** - View auctions the bidder has registered for
10. **View Auction Items** - View items available in an auction
11. **Place Bid** - Submit a bid for an item in an auction
12. **View Latest Bid** - Check the current highest bid for an item
13. **View Purchased Items** - View items won by the bidder

### Admin Use Cases
14. **Manage Auction** - Parent use case for auction management operations
15. **Create Auction** - Create a new auction (included in "Manage Auction")
16. **Add Items to Auction** - Add items to an existing auction (included in "Manage Auction")
17. **Manage Bidders** - Parent use case for bidder management operations
18. **View Registered Bidders** - View all bidders registered for an auction (included in "Manage Bidders")
19. **Remove Bidder from Auction** - Remove a bidder's registration from an auction (included in "Manage Bidders")
20. **Sell Item** - Finalize the sale of an item to the winning bidder
21. **View All Users** - View all users in the system

## Relationships

### Include Relationships
The diagram shows several **<<include>>** relationships:

1. **View Auctions** includes:
   - View Upcoming Auctions
   - View Live Auctions
   - View Completed Auctions

2. **Manage Auction** includes:
   - Create Auction
   - Add Items to Auction

3. **Manage Bidders** includes:
   - View Registered Bidders
   - Remove Bidder from Auction

These relationships indicate that the included use cases are essential parts of the base use case and are always executed when the base use case is performed.

## System Boundary
All use cases are contained within the "Auction System" boundary, which represents the scope of the system being developed.

## Implementation Mapping

### Controllers
The use cases map to the following Spring Boot controllers:

- **UserController** (`/api/users`):
  - Register User (`/register`)
  - Login (`/login`)
  - Change Password (`/changePassword/{userId}`)
  - View All Users (`/all`)
  - Register for Auction (`/registerAuction`)
  - View Registered Auctions (`/registered/{userId}`)
  - View Purchased Items (`/purchases/{userId}/{auctionId}`)
  - Get Unregistered Auctions (`/unregistered/{userId}`)

- **AuctionController** (`/api/auctions`):
  - View Upcoming Auctions (`/upcoming`)
  - View Live Auctions (`/live`)
  - View Completed Auctions (`/completed`)
  - Create Auction (`/createAuction`)
  - Add Items to Auction (`/addItem/{auctionId}`)
  - View Auction Items (`/auctionItems/{auctionId}`)

- **BidController** (`/api/bids`):
  - Place Bid (`/placeBid`)
  - View Latest Bid (`/latestBid/{auctionId}/{itemId}`)
  - Sell Item (`/sellItem/{itemId}`)

- **AdminController** (`/api/admin`):
  - View Registered Bidders (`/bidders/{auctionId}`)
  - Remove Bidder from Auction (`/deleteBidder/{auctionId}/{userId}`)

### Models
The main domain models in the system:
- **Users** - Represents both bidders and admins
- **Auction** - Represents an auction event
- **Item** - Represents items being auctioned
- **Bid** - Represents a bid placed on an item
- **BidRegistration** - Represents a bidder's registration for an auction

## Color Coding
The diagram uses color coding to improve readability:
- **Yellow** (#fff2cc) - Common use cases (Register, Login, Change Password)
- **Light Green** (#d5e8d4) - Bidder-specific use cases
- **Light Red** (#f8cecc) - Admin-specific use cases
- **Light Purple** (#e1d5e7) - Included use cases (sub-functionalities)
- **Light Blue** (#dae8fc) - System boundary and Bidder actor
- **Light Red** (#f8cecc) - Admin actor

## Notes
- The diagram follows UML use case diagram conventions
- All use cases identified from the codebase are included
- The relationships accurately represent the system's functionality
- The diagram can be modified using draw.io/diagrams.net for future updates
